;; Rules to match eslint output in `compilation-mode'.

;;; Code:

(require 'compile)

;;;###autoload
(defun compile-eslint--find-filename ()
  "Find the filename for current error."
  (save-match-data
    (save-excursion
      (when (re-search-backward (rx bol (group "/" (+ any)) eol))
        (list (match-string 1))))))

;;;###autoload
(let ((form `(eslint
              ,(rx-to-string
                '(and (group (group (+ digit)) ":" (group (+ digit)))
                      (+ " ") (or "error" "warning")))
              compile-eslint--find-filename
              2 3 2 1)))
  (if (assq 'eslint compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist)
      (setf (cdr (assq 'eslint compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist)) (cdr form))
    (push form compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist)))
